My main areas of interest are spatial statistics and their usage in demographic
and population data; and public health demography, focusing on inequalities
in infectious disease vulnerability. 

# Chagas disease
Using data from Brazil's SINAN database, I am creating small-area estimates
of incidence of acute Chagas disease using a Bayesian spatial hierarchical model.
I use climate data and projections to estimate future burden of acute Chagas
given the changing climate.

# Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Survey
I am using BICS data to construct profiles of employment-based vulnerability 
to COVID-19 for determining optimal vaccination strategy.

# Berkeley Interdisciplinary Migration Initiative
With BIMI's _Mapping Spatial Inequality_ project, I create composite spatial
indices based on the Two-Step Floating Catchment Area methodology 
(Luo and Wang, 2003).  We are analyzing where accessibility to nonprofit health
and legal services for immigrants is abundant and where it is poor,
and identifying determinants and patterns therein.


# Qualifying Exams
I took QEs in Spatial Demography (empahsis on Spatial Statistics) and 
Public Health Demography. You can read my materials here:
