We have been in COVID-19 lockdown for a whole year. Holy moly! I feel
like I quantum tunneled from last March until now. This blows my mind—I
feel like it has been forever, and at the same time, no time at all.

More than anything, I have learned that I really, really love walking. I
spend all day parked in front of my computer in my living room. I sleep
20 feet behind me. I cook meals 10 feet to my right. I am intertly
trapped in these walls.

When I first moved to Berkeley in 2018, I was bored one day and decided
to walk just around the neighborhood. “This is so weird!” I remember
thinking. “Who takes walks for fun? Walking is a means of
transportation, not an activity!”

I don’t think I’ve so dramatically changed my mind on anything.

Going for a good medium-length walk has been my ‘anchoring vignette’ of
the pandemic. I try and do it every day. More than two days without
walking and I feel it: I don’t sleep right, I’m eating like garbage, I’m
anxious and antsy.  
Quite literally, walking keeps me sane.

It took some experimentation but I settled on a good 4-ish mile loop. I
live at the base of the Berkeley hills and walk as directly up the hill
as possible. I try to really push myself here: brisk pace, heart rate
up. At the top, I take a lazy, winding path down. The whole thing takes
exactly and hour and a half.

It’s a little hard to see because of the way Alltrails does feature
layering, but my main walks are red and purple; green is the “short”
version and blue is “I have the whole afternoon off” version. (I started
and stopped not exactly at my apartment, for privacy, I guess.)

Here’s the view from Lawrence Hall of Science (The top of the purple
route). You can see my apartment in here, actually. [Lawrence

If you have an Android phone, Google tracks your location always
(“Timeline”). This is a little spooky from a cybersecurity and data
ethics perspective, but I think it’s kind of neat to be able to look
back on where I’ve been. You can download your data from [Google
Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/). I selected “Fit” (walking and
tracking data) and “Timeline” (KML shapefiles).

Let’s start with the Fit data:

      "./Takeout 2/Fit/Daily activity metrics/Daily activity metrics.csv",
      col_types = cols()
      )
    head(daily_activity_metrics)

There’s a lot of information here, and most of it isn’t super useful.
Let’s pull some cols after the lockdown began (March 16th, 2020 for me)

    daily_activity_metrics <- daily_activity_metrics %>%
      filter(lubridate::as_date(Date) >= lubridate::as_date("2020-03-16")) %>%
      select(Date, 
             kcal  = `Calories (kcal)`,
             steps = `Step count`,
             distance = `Distance (m)`,
             move_mins = `Move Minutes count`,
             walking_duration = `Walking duration (ms)`) %>%
      drop_na()
    head(daily_activity_metrics)

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 6
    ##   Date        kcal steps distance move_mins walking_duration
    ##   <date>     <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>            <dbl>

    ## 4 2020-03-19 1943. 12953    7208.       137          5765957
    ## 5 2020-03-20 2222.  1895   22351.       172           134521

First, let’s look at steps:

    ggplot(daily_activity_metrics) +
      geom_point(aes(Date, steps))

![](/assets/img/2021-03-15-walking/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

I think that high point in July was hiking Cloud’s rest in Yosemite.

And then distance:

    ggplot(daily_activity_metrics) +
      geom_point(aes(Date, distance))

![](/assets/img/2021-03-15-walking/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

I have no idea what this 60-km walk was…. likely something weird with
GPS (sometimes it thinks that I was walking when I was actually just
driving really slowly).

There’s naturally a pretty strong correlation between distance and
steps:

    ggplot(daily_activity_metrics) +
      geom_point(aes(steps, distance))

![](/assets/img/2021-03-15-walking/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

    summary(lm(distance~steps, data = daily_activity_metrics))

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = distance ~ steps, data = daily_activity_metrics)
    ## 
    ## Residuals:
    ##    Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max 
    ##  -2146   -855   -666   -165  60681 
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:
    ##              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
    ## (Intercept) 495.00110  368.67460   1.343     0.18    
    ## steps         0.58932    0.03454  17.063   <2e-16 ***
    ## ---
    ## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
    ## 
    ## Residual standard error: 3796 on 350 degrees of freedom
    ## Multiple R-squared:  0.4541, Adjusted R-squared:  0.4525 
    ## F-statistic: 291.1 on 1 and 350 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16

This estimates one of my steps as being approximately 0.58 meters, or
1.9 feet. I’m about 5’5 (on a good day): according to this [probably not
very accurate
table](https://www.verywellfit.com/set-pedometer-better-accuracy-3432895),
my stride length should be 27", which is slightly too long. I have short
legs, I guess!

Out of pure interest, calories:

    ggplot(daily_activity_metrics) +
      geom_point(aes(Date, kcal))

![](/assets/img/2021-03-15-walking/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

Funny: the last dot is below 1000 calories: that’s probably today, when
it’s still morning and I haven’t gone outside yet! Funny.

I have reason to think that there is one anomaly (oh! I think I went
biking that day). I’m going to filter that one out:

    daily_activity_metrics <- daily_activity_metrics %>%
      filter(distance < 60000)

Sum it up and convert to miles:

    sum(daily_activity_metrics$distance)/1609

    ## [1] 1220.033

Holy moly! 1,220 miles I’ve walked in a year! That’s nuts, man. That’s
about 3.3 per day, which is consistent with my normal walk (between 3-4
miles), but obviously I did a little more some days and took a few off.
