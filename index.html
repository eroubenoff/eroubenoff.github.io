I am a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, in the department of Demography. I am interested in spatial demography methodology and human geography, with a focus on residential inequality, mobility, and transportation.

Currently, I am working on projects relating to demographic small-area estimation using techniques like Kriging and Bayesian hierarchical MCMC.

I am researcher with the Berkeley Interdisciplinary Migration Initiative working on the Mapping Spatial Inequality project. I have previously been affiliated with the Human Mortality Database.

Previous research includes: pattern analysis of income and race clustering around Chicago CTA stations; Chicago spatial voter information collection, display, and analysis with the Chicago Democracy Project; and the role of doctor-patient relationships in breast cancer treatment efficacy.
